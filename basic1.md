- cluster is group of nodes
- each node has multiple containerized applications
- so there is one master node, which handles all the worker nodes, worker nodes has containerized applications, master just manages worker nodes. 
- each worker node has containerized applications, so these application runs on pod. pod is single instance of a running process in a cluster. it can run one or more containers and share same resources. So if an application requires multiple containers to run, we can put all these in one pod

Kubernetes has a **well-defined set of components**, and once you understand them, Kubernetes becomes much less scary 🙂

I’ll explain them **layer by layer**, from top to bottom.

---

## 1️⃣ Kubernetes Cluster (Big Picture)

A **Kubernetes cluster** has **two main parts**:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Control Plane     │  ← Brain
└─────────────────────┘
        │
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Worker Nodes      │  ← Muscles
└─────────────────────┘
```

---

## 2️⃣ Control Plane Components (The Brain 🧠)

These components **decide what should happen** in the cluster.

### 2.1 **kube-apiserver**

📌 **Most important component**

* Entry point to Kubernetes
* All commands (`kubectl`) go through this
* Validates requests and updates cluster state

```text
kubectl → kube-apiserver → cluster
```

---

### 2.2 **etcd**

📦 **Key-value database**
* It is a key-value store of a Cluster. The Cluster State Changes get stored in the etcd. It acts as the Cluster brain because it tells the Scheduler and other processes about which resources are available and about cluster state changes.
* Stores all cluster data:

  * Pods
  * Services
  * Configs
  * Secrets
* Source of truth for Kubernetes

If etcd is lost → cluster state is lost ⚠️

---

### 2.3 **kube-scheduler**

🧭 Decides **where a Pod runs**

* Chooses the best worker node to a newly created pods
* When API Server receives a request for Scheduling Pods then the request is passed on to the Scheduler. It intelligently decides on which node to schedule the pod for better efficiency of the cluster.
* means assign n
* Considers:

  * CPU
  * Memory
  * Node health
  * Constraints

---

### 2.4 **kube-controller-manager**

🎮 Runs controllers that maintain **desired state**

Examples:

* ReplicaSet Controller
* Node Controller
* Job Controller

```text
Desired: 3 pods
Actual: 2 pods
→ Controller creates 1 more
```

---

### 2.5 **cloud-controller-manager** (optional)

☁️ For cloud integrations

* Load balancers
* Volumes
* Node management

Used in AWS, GCP, Azure.

---

## 3️⃣ Worker Node Components (The Muscles 💪)

These components **run your applications**.

---

### 3.1 **kubelet**

🤖 Agent on each node

* Talks to kube-apiserver
* Ensures containers are running in a pod
* Reports node & pod status
*  kubelet interacts with both the container runtime as well as the Node. It is the process responsible for starting a pod with a container inside.


---

### 3.2 **Container Runtime**

A container runtime is needed to run the application containers running on pods inside a pod. Example-> Docker
---

### 3.3 **kube-proxy**

🌐 Networking component

* Handles pod-to-pod communication
* Service load balancing
* Uses iptables / IPVS

---

## 4️⃣ Kubernetes Objects (What you create)

These are **not processes**, but **resources** you define.

| Object         | Purpose                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Pod**        | Smallest unit (container wrapper) |
| **Deployment** | Manages pods & updates            |
| **Service**    | Stable networking                 |
| **ReplicaSet** | Keeps desired pod count           |
| **ConfigMap**  | Config data                       |
| **Secret**     | Sensitive data                    |
| **Ingress**    | HTTP routing                      |
| **Namespace**  | Logical isolation                 |

---

## 5️⃣ Add-ons (Optional but common)

| Add-on                | Purpose         |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| CoreDNS               | Internal DNS    |
| Dashboard             | Web UI          |
| Metrics Server        | Autoscaling     |
| Ingress Controller    | Traffic routing |
| CNI (Calico, Flannel) | Networking      |

---

## 6️⃣ Very Simple Flow (End-to-End)

```text
kubectl apply → kube-apiserver
              ↓
           etcd (store)
              ↓
      scheduler picks node
              ↓
      kubelet runs container
              ↓
      kube-proxy exposes service
```

---

## TL;DR (Memory-friendly)

🧠 **Control Plane**

* API Server
* etcd
* Scheduler
* Controller Manager

💪 **Worker Node**

* kubelet
* container runtime
* kube-proxy

📦 **Objects**

* Pod
* Deployment
* Service
* ConfigMap
* Secret
